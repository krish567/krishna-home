## Abstract

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated great success in modeling reflective 3D objects and their interaction with the environment via **deferred rendering (DR)**. However, existing methods often struggle with correctly reconstructing physical attributes such as albedo and reflectance, and therefore they do not support high-fidelity relighting. Observing that this limitation stems from the lack of **shape and material** information in RGB images, we present PhyGaP, a physically-grounded 3DGS method that leverages polarization cues to facilitate precise reflection decomposition and visually consistent relighting of reconstructed objects. Specifically, we design a polarimetric deferred rendering (PolarDR) process to model polarization by reflection, and a self-occlusion-aware environment map building technique (GridMap) to resolve indirect lighting of non-convex objects. We validate on multiple synthetic and real-world scenes, including those featuring only partial polarization cues, that PhyGaP not only excels in reconstructing the appearance and surface normal of reflective 3D objects (~2 dB in PSNR and 45.7% in Cosine Distance better than existing RGB-based methods on average), but also achieves state-of-the-art inverse rendering and relighting capability.
